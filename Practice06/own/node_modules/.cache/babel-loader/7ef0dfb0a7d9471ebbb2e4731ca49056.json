Maureen Orth’s Vanity Fair article which states 10 UNDENIABLE FACTS about the allegations was widely shared as an evidence of Jackson’s guilt. Let us consider Orth’s history in joining the media delirium against him. In 2003, Vanity Fair published an article by Orth titled ‘Losing His Grip’,where she wrote that Michael Jackson bathed in sheep blood, sacrificed 42 cows as a ritual hiring a voodoo priest to put a death curse on David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and his enemies and to be blessed. Except,there’s no evidence to suggest this to be true and it’s rather dubious if an individual with rational thought-process will ever buy such an outlandish story. In another 2004 article,titled ‘The Neverland’s Lost Boys’, she implied that Jackson intoxicated Richard Matsuura when he was 13 years old. Richard denounced her claims to be ‘completely false’. He confirmed that neither he or his father were contacted for verifying the allegations.She never retracted her words or issued any apology. Matsuura’s name was quietly removed from the online versions of the article.\", \"A defamation lawsuit was also filed against Maureen Orth this month for her book ‘The Vulgar Favors’. The plaintiff claimed in the lawsuit that they had sued Orth in 2000 for invasion of privacy and defamation and reached a confidential settlement. It stated that Orth violated the agreement with the show ‘The Assassination of Gianni Versace:American Crime Story’, which aired on FX and is also available on Netflix, where the plaintiff is being falsely implicated as an alcohol abuser. The suit also mentioned that Maureen Orth ‘has personal knowledge that the defamatory matter was false because she fabricated it herself.’ It’s therefore prominent that Orth doesn’t seek for fairness of facts.    The most perpetuated logic used by media gurus and Dan Reed in order to make us believe Wade’s and Safechuck’s claims is that their stories are parallel. This is what makes the documentary powerful,according to them. Reed, in several interviews asserted that despite the fact that Wade and Safechuck had never met each other until the Sundance festival, the individual accounts of their alleged abuse are so similar. In his interview to the Rolling Stones,he said that both men were kept apart for legal reasons and Sundance was the first time, they had met as adults. So, there’s no way these two men could have exchanged their stories.\", \"This is not the only claim of Reed. Since January, he has appeared in several interviews and talk shows, supporting their allegations. He repeatedly asserts that Wade and Safechuck have no financial interests which sounds ironic as they both have filed lawsuits against the estate, demanding millions for damages and is still under appeal. Robson was secretly shopping for a book deal in 2012 in which he called himself ‘a master of deception’ ,before filing his lawsuit in 2013 and was assisted by his long time friend and lawyer Helen Yu, helping him to contact several publishers. Eventually, no publisher picked it up. He initially tried to hide the book draft from the legal team representing Jackson’s companies. They only discovered it after they were granted a Motion to Compel. It was also revealed that Robson had exchanged a string of emails with a literary agent called Alan Nevins and Helen Yu, discussing his book, to be able to sell it. Nevins stated that Wade had asked for a large amount of money for his book. The estate found a note written by Robson during the discovery process that stated,’My story of abuse and it’s effects will make me relatable /relevant.
