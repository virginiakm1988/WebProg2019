Jackson was charged for allegedly molesting Gavin Arvizo, in 2005 and the case was exposed to be nothing but ‘fabrications’ by overwhelming evidence.The Arvizos were proven con artists who admitted under oath that they had previously accused JC Penny guards for molestation to earn a settlement. There were no financial payoffs to anyone. It’s very irresponsible on her part to delude her readers with such misinformation.

Isn’t it exhilarating how they refuse to accept the ‘not guilty’ verdict in the case of MJ but revere a ‘convicted’ physician instead?    Maureen Orth’s Vanity Fair article which states 10 UNDENIABLE FACTS about the allegations was widely shared as an evidence of Jackson’s guilt. Let us consider Orth’s history in joining the media delirium against him. In 2003, Vanity Fair published an article by Orth titled ‘Losing His Grip’,where she wrote that Michael Jackson bathed in sheep blood, sacrificed 42 cows as a ritual hiring a voodoo priest to put a death curse on David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and his enemies and to be blessed. Except,there’s no evidence to suggest this to be true and it’s rather dubious if an individual with rational thought-process will ever buy such an outlandish story. In another 2004 article,titled ‘The Neverland’s Lost Boys’, she implied that Jackson intoxicated Richard Matsuura when he was 13 years old. Richard denounced her claims to be ‘completely false’. He confirmed that neither he or his father were contacted for verifying the allegations.She never retracted her words or issued any apology. Matsuura’s name was quietly removed from the online versions of the article.\"];\nexport default (function (_ref) {\n  var id = _ref.id;\n  return React.createElement(\"article\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 16\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, React.createElement(\"h1\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 17\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Post #\", id), React.createElement(\"h2\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 18\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Facts dont lie, people do.\"), React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 19\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"This is the \", id, \"-th post\"), React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 20\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, text[id - 1]));\n});","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/home/virginia/WebProg2019/Practice06/own/src/components/Post/Post.js"],"names":["React","text","id"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AAEA,IAAIC,IAAI,GAAG,CACP,wiCADO,EAGP,2+CAHO,EAKP,o5CALO,CAAX;AAWA,gBAAe,gBAAY;AAAA,MAATC,EAAS,QAATA,EAAS;AACvB,SACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,eAAWA,EAAX,CADJ,EAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kCAFJ,EAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qBAAgBA,EAAhB,aAHJ,EAII;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KAAID,IAAI,CAACC,EAAE,GAAC,CAAJ,CAAR,CAJJ,CADJ;AAQH,CATD","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\n\nvar text = [\n    \"Both defended Michael Jackson under oath that they were never molested.
