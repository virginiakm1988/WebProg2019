      <h1> 
        This is a Heading (h1)
      </h1>
      <h2>
        This is a Heading too! (h2)
      </h2>
      <h3>
        This is also a Heading! (h3)
      </h3>
      <h4>
        This just goes on...
      </h4>
      <h5>
        and on..

    <div class="content">
      <p class = block>
        This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here:<br>
        and continues...

      <p class = block>
        There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <I>italicc</I>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
<font style="background-color:yellow">the</font> <s>list</s> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
      </p>
      <div class = block>
        You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
          <blockquote>
            Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
          </blockquote>

        <div>
          A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
and take up the full width available.
        </div>
        <span>
          And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
        </span>
      </p>
